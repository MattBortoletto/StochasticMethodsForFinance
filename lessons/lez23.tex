This fact has the following consequence. \lesson{23}{30/04/2020}
\begin{proposition}[Defaultable bond]
    The down-and-out bond with barrier $L$ is priced by the formula
    \begin{equation}
        BO_{LO}(t,s) = \left[H(t,s,L) - \left(\dfrac{2\Tilde{r}}{\sigma^2}\right)H\left(t,\frac{L^2}{s},L\right)\right]\mathds{1}_{s>L}.
    \end{equation}
\end{proposition}
This contract will thus pay out 1 dollar at time $T$ only if the stock price is above the level $L$ during the entire contract period. \\
Now we consider something which is not quoted in the market but that is a building block to price something which indeed is quoted.
\begin{proposition}[Down-and-out on stock]
    The down-and-out contract on the underlying stock is given by
    \begin{align}
        \notag ST_{LO}(t,s) &= \left[LH(t,s,L) - L\left(\dfrac{2\Tilde{r}}{\sigma^2}\right)H\left(t,\frac{L^2}{s},L\right) + \right. \\
        &\qquad\qquad
        \left. + C(t,s,L) - \left(\dfrac{2\Tilde{r}}{\sigma^2}\right)C\left(t,\frac{L^2}{s},L\right)\right]\mathds{1}_{s>L}.
    \end{align}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    From Theorem 
\end{proof}
